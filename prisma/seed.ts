On the contrary! Svelte's compiler approach, React's Server Components or esbuild's performance (via not using JavaScript) are groundbreaking changes that will shape the next generation. If the "Big 3" will adopt or vanish, is another topic...
Join my talk and see how these new approaches expand the frontiers even more.`,

Easy job for you, right?"As we all know, that's just the beginning. It continues with further layout changes, adding new features or modifying existing ones. That's definitely not easy anymore. In my talk, I'll show you multiple design patterns/strategies for white label solutions. You will see how to unleash the full potential of the Angular framework to make your application as much customizable as possible.`,
